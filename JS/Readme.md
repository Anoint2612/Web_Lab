### This is what I learned:

While working on Questions 3 and the Bonus task, I understood how JavaScript handles **variable hoisting and scope**. I saw that when we use `var`, the variable gets hoisted but is initialized with `undefined`, whereas using `let` or `const` before declaration leads to an error. This helped me understand the concept of the **Temporal Dead Zone** and how scoping works in JavaScript.  
The Bonus question showed me that **local variables declared inside functions can't be accessed globally**, which is an important concept for writing clean and secure code.

In the Activity Evaluation mini project, I got to apply multiple core JavaScript concepts in a practical scenario. I used **global variables** to store student names and scores, and created a **function declaration** to calculate the total score. I also explored **function expressions** to assign ranks based on the score, and used an **anonymous function** to calculate the average.  
The task also helped me understand **lexical scope**, where an inner function can access variables from its outer function. I revisited **hoisting** and saw how `var` behaves when used before declaration. Finally, I experimented with **scope isolation** to understand the difference between block scope and function scope.

Overall, this question gave me a better understanding of how different JavaScript concepts work together in a real-world example, and helped me strengthen my fundamentals through hands-on practice.
